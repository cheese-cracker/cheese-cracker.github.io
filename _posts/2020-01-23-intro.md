### Sitemap

Welcome to my website! Here, is a quick overview of what exists on this website.
This website is a modification on 'chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue'.
The first page is the Homepage, which includes some of the projects I have done.
Apart from this there are three other categories of posts,
1. Notes - This consists of academic notes of various subjects. It is probably the most interesting page. 
> If you're not sure where to start, checkout the P.O.E notes on the notes tab.
2. Blog - Consists of general blog information, if any at all!
3. Reports - Sometimes project reports are here.
