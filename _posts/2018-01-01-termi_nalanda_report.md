#### Report of KWoC and the selected project Termi-Nalanda
##### About KWoC and Choosing a project
KWoC or Kharagpur Winter of Code is a miniature version of GSOC and is aimed to encourage open source development. The KWoC program spans over the entire of December 2017  from 2nd to 31st.<br>
The project I chose for KWoC is [Termi-Nalanda](https://github.com/Pro-Panda/nalanda-cli) (which is now called nalanda-cli).This project is by my mentor Rahul Bothra [@pro-panda](https://github.com/Pro-Panda).
##### Contributions during KWoC 
During the first two weeks (i.e till  15 Dec 2017), I was busy with my comprehensive exams and therefore could not contribute much to KWoC. Also, I was fairly new to github and how things work so I most of my updates were minor ones.<br><br>
My first pull request was a fruitless attempt to concise the code. I was unaware of the PEP8 guidelines and my attempt to concise the code went against the guidelines so I closed the pull request.<br>
I later went ahead to make another small change to the project of correcting error statements as my first proper contribution while setting PEP8 for this I also found a way to shorten line 7 to follow the guideline.<br><br>
Having done all this, I was now acquainted with using git both on the terminal and web. This inspired me to work on my previous git repository text_editor which I modified.<br><br>
Towards the end of KWoC(25-27), I finally used the knowledge that I had gained in my own project and combine it with Termi-Nalanda by making a GUI for it using Tkinter. While making this GUI, I also made some changes to the project by making parts of it object-oriented. However, due to some problems in the running of the termi-nalanda software, I could not test my changes at all. I contacted my mentor due to this problem and he gave me advice on how to tackle it.<br><br>
Having gotten the advice from my mentor, I managed to fix the problem and test my code. I had to do some further changes to code. After completing the changes I opened a pull request and set it according to PEP8. I was extremely proud of the fact that I had managed to do a significant contribution to the project.
##### Verdict
An amazing project with an equally amazing learning experience (especially from the mentor). Although my final code did have some minor problems, it was ultimately a good project.
